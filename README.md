**Frontend sample work project for ContractHound from Olena Dmytrenko**



Layout/UI changes:

* Moved .container class to wrap around all other components
* Added .col-12 inside .row around breadrumbs because they go off the screen
* Removed unexpected div (line 323) and select (line 424 ) as they cause errors
* Replaced .card-header with .card-body as it's a building block of a card
* Added card's headings hierarchy
* General padding/margin issues (card bottom wasn't showing)
* Added bootstrap component for information/notification  & some icons (font awesome)

Thank you!
